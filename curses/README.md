# Enclosure Game

A linux console game written in C.

## How to play

In the game, you need to control yourself, an elf, drawing lines, closing more and more areas, until (almost) the whole screen has been occupied.

The evil elves always want to break your line to make you die, so be careful. Note they can only move in the remaining spaces, and closing them will kill them, so try.
